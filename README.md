## Code challenge


### Problem description

A client of door2door would like a custom landing page built for them to enhance their marketing campagne. The aim of this landing page is to showcase their app's features and the way their app works.

### What we expect you to build

Our designers have already prepared the designs for the landing page (desktop + mobile), which can be found [here](http://zpl.io/aw0DXE1). If you don't have access to the project yet, contact us and we will fix this right away!

If you've never used Zeplin before, you can watch [this introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHmzAytSgpI).

All assets necessary to build this landing page are exportable on Zeplin, just click on an image, select the desired format and download. On Zeplin, you can also find notes, which describe the behaviour of some components.

We would like you to build a landing page that:

1. Implements the provided desktop and mobile designs as a single page website.

2. Implements a map component (you can choose your favourite map provider - Google, Mapbox, etc), which draws the area of [the example region](./region.json) returned in a response from our API.

## Code submission

Please send us a ZIP file with your solution privately, together with the instructions on how to get the project started locally.
